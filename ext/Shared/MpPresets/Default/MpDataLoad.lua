-- If you're trying to create your own multiplayer preset, you're in the right place to learn how.
-- I've put comments below to try and show you how to create your own preset, so you can make a Rush map out of the Comrades map, or a 1v1 TDM map out of The Eleventh Hour.

-- First, you need to load in the right multiplayer data - that's what this Lua file does.
-- The fundamental method for making a multiplayer preset is that you need two parts: the SP or COOP level you want to make the preset for, and the MP level you're using to copy logic from.

-- By the way, as a rule of thumb, if there's no comment by a bit of code saying to change it, DON'T CHANGE IT!

-- You can use the ThunderRun_CQL preset (adding Conquest Large to Thunder Run SP_Tank) for another set of examples, although unannotated.

-- For any questions, SassythSasqutch#9081 on Discord is more than willing to help.

    if levelName == nil or gameModeName == nil then
        return
    end

    -- Don't continue if the level is not any singleplayer or coop level in TDM CQ. Change TeamDeathMatchC0 to whatever gamemode you're using.
    -- You will also need to specify the SP/COOP map you're building your preset for. See ThunderRun_CQL for an example of a map-specific preset.
    -- E.g., put (string.find(levelName, 'sp_paris') == nil) if you're making a preset for Comrades.
    -- This is so your preset only loads when the SP/COOP level and gamemode you want is loading.
    -- PLEASE don't use the TeamDeathMatchC0 gamemode. It is reserved for this (default) preset for exploration.

-- That's everything we need to load the multiplayer data we need. Now we need to tell the SP/COOP level how to load our chosen gamemode.
-- That's all done by the CreateGameModeSubWorldRef.lua script.
-- After that, there are a few more optional things to do. Those are detailed at the end of the CreateGameModeSubWorldRef.lua script.
