-- If you're trying to create your own multiplayer preset, you're in the right place to learn how.
-- I've put comments below to try and show you how to create your own preset, so you can make a Rush map out of the Comrades map, or a 1v1 TDM map out of The Eleventh Hour.

-- First, you need to load in the right multiplayer data - that's what this Lua file does.
-- The fundamental method for making a multiplayer preset is that you need two parts: the SP or COOP level you want to make the preset for, and the MP level you're using to copy logic from.

-- By the way, as a rule of thumb, if there's no comment by a bit of code saying to change it, DON'T CHANGE IT!

-- You can use the ThunderRun_CQL preset (adding Conquest Large to Thunder Run SP_Tank) for another set of examples, although unannotated.

-- For any questions, SassythSasqutch#9081 on Discord is more than willing to help.

    ResourceManager:MountSuperBundle('xp2chunks') -- Change this. This is a superbundle containing data for each DLC. Back to Karkand is XP1, Close Quarters is XP2, etcetera. If you're using a vanilla map, you don't need this.

        return
    end

    -- Don't continue if the level is not any singleplayer or coop level in TDM CQ. Change TeamDeathMatchC0 to whatever gamemode you're using.
    -- You will also need to specify the SP/COOP map you're building your preset for. See ThunderRun_CQL for an example of a map-specific preset.
    -- E.g., put (string.find(levelName, 'sp_paris') == nil) if you're making a preset for Comrades.
    -- This is so your preset only loads when the SP/COOP level and gamemode you want is loading.

    -- These need some digging. Find the RegistryContainers for the LevelData of your MP level, and the SubWorld(s) for the gamemode you're using.
    -- For example, here, the 'Ziba Tower' registry is from http://webx.powback.com/#/Levels/XP2_Skybar/XP2_Skybar.json. Press the orange bold text saying 'RegistryContainer' (might take a sec to load, these are big), and copy the partitiona and instance GUIDs.
    -- We also need the registries for the TeamDeathMatchC0 SubWorlds (remember, each gamemode is represented by a SubWorld).
    -- Ziba Tower works kinda funny, and there's first a 'Deathmatch' SubWorld, whose RegistryContainer can be seen here: http://webx.powback.com/#/Levels/XP2_Skybar/DeathMatch.json
    -- This then leads to a 'TeamDM' SubWorld, whose RegistryContainer can be seen here: http://webx.powback.com/#/Levels/XP2_Skybar/TeamDM.json
    -- You'll learn to love (hate) these SubWorlds very soon, when you need to inject them into the SP/COOP partitions. That's next.

    -- http://webx.powback.com is a great resource.

-- That's everything we need to load the multiplayer data we need. Now we need to tell the SP/COOP level how to load our chosen gamemode.
-- That's all done by the CreateGameModeSubWorldRef.lua script.
-- After that, there are a few more optional things to do. Those are detailed at the end of the CreateGameModeSubWorldRef.lua script.
