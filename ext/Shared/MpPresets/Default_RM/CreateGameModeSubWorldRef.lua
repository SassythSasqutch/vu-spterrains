-- New to making custom layouts/presets? Read the comments in 'Shared/MpPresets/Default/MpDataLoad.lua' first.

-- So, after you've loaded all the MP data you need, it's time to tell your SP or COOP level to use that data. Here's how.

-- In a nutshell, for multiplayer maps, different gamemodes are different subworlds, each referenced in the main level partition (e.g. Levels/XP2_Skybar/XP2_Skybar).
-- This script clones the SubWorldReferenceObjectData from the XP2_Skybar main level partition, and adds it to the singleplayer/co-op map being loaded.
-- What's the SubWorldReferenceObjectData now? That's what points the level towards (references) the right gamemode (SubWorld). Hence SubWorld-Reference-ObjectData.

-- This sounds complicated, but is remarkably easy (I know, the simplicity of it got me the first time: I massively overcomplicated it).
-- Again, instructions for how to do this are annotated below. Message SassythSasqutch#9081 on Discord with any questions. Literally anything. Please speak to me.

Events:Subscribe('Partition:Loaded', function(partition)

    local levelName = SharedUtils:GetLevelName()
    local gameModeName = SharedUtils:GetCurrentGameMode()

    -- Don't read any partition that's nil or not referring to the main level partition of the currently loading map
    if partition == nil or levelName == nil or partition.name ~= string.lower(levelName) or partition.primaryInstance.typeInfo.name ~= 'LevelData' then
        return
    end

    -- Don't continue if the level is not any singleplayer or coop level in TDM CQ.
    -- Again, change this to have the exact same code as on line 45 of MpDataLoad.lua, so that this code only runs when we're loading the map and gamemodes we want.
    if (string.find(levelName, 'COOP_') == nil and string.find(levelName, 'SP_') == nil) or gameModeName ~= 'TeamDeathMatchC0' then
        return
    end

    -- Again, Ziba Tower is funny, so it puts all its gamemodes under the 'Deathmatch' SubWorld, so that's all we need to point our SP/COOP level towards.

    -- Deathmatch --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    local zibaDeathmatchSubWorldReferenceObjectData = SubWorldReferenceObjectData(ResourceManager:FindInstanceByGuid(Guid('2DF41167-0BAB-11E1-AA4E-EFBA5D767A10'), Guid('E031587A-9C68-4A85-A05E-204F6C8122DA')))
    -- We are just copying what Ziba Tower uses to point itself towards the 'Deathmatch' SubWorld, so you can find this in the LevelData of the MP map you're using.
    -- I found this one by going to http://webx.powback.com/#/Levels/XP2_Skybar/XP2_Skybar.json.
    -- I found and opened the 'Objects' dropdown near the bottom, and found the SubWorldReferenceObjectData I wanted. That's the one with the BundleName 'Levels/XP2_Skybar/DeathMatch' when I expanded it.
    -- I copied the partition and instance GUIDs and pasted them above, as you can see.
    -- Of course, you will need to find your own. You can use the exact same method.

    -- Add to LevelData 'Objects' array
    local spLevelData = LevelData(partition.primaryInstance)
    spLevelData:MakeWritable()
    spLevelData.objects:add(zibaDeathmatchSubWorldReferenceObjectData)

end)

-- That's it. Your preset is ready. Load the singleplayer or COOP map you made it for in the right gamemode, and it 'should' work.
-- I put 'should' in inverted commas bc I know these things never work first time. Message me if you need a hand.

-- Remember that you will need to put the address for all the Lua files you made in ext/Shared/__init__.lua. 
-- Just put it below where all the other MpPreset ones are. You can use those ones as examples, so you know how to do it.
